# Chapter 5: The Population Conspiracy Theory

While it would be easy to write a chapter for each of the unique problems the LGBTQIA community faces every day of their lives, I want to focus instead on where the hatred and discrimination really stem from.

Of course, it would be easy to place the blame on religion and say that it is only because of outdated and mistranslated holy texts. This avoids the issue and pushes it back a step rather than questioning why the religions became anti-gay.

Instead, I propose a new theory that ties the discrimination against Gay, Transgender, and Asexual people.

Did you know that Asexual people are sometimes raped because people want to "correct" them or because they are seen as a challenge to get them to have sex because they are not interested?

Indeed, some people dislike Gay, Transgender, and Asexual people for a common reason. This reason is because these groups are the least likely to reproduce.

- A gay couple of the same sex cannot get anyone pregnant by having sex with the same sex.
- A transgender person, more often than not, takes hormones that diminish their sexual desire and, in many cases, even has surgery to remove their sex organs.
- An asexual person is very unlikely to have sex because it doesn't interest them.

Because these people don't reproduce at the same rate as heterosexuals, some people have an irrational fear that the human race will go extinct because straight sex will stop happening. That plot would make a great science fiction movie that won't happen.

But I have another theory about this that explains why some people have a financial incentive to keep the population as high as they can. Therefore, they see it as their duty to eliminate anyone who is not heterosexual or cisgender.

If you think about it, the very rich, especially business owners, benefit by having a large population.

- More customers means more products sold.
- More competition for the limited available jobs means employers can always find desperate people willing to work for low wages yet feel grateful for having a job.
- More poverty and unhappy people lead to more crime. Then they can be killed or jailed to eliminate the "undesirables".
- More people means there are more people to tax and otherwise exploit for financial gain.

If somebody wanted to keep the population high, they would try to do the following:

- Ban or limit all forms of birth control.
- Eliminate the LGBTQIA population and promote heterosexual marriage and sex.
- Ban surgeries that sterilize people.

## Relevant Links about declining birthrates

I have included some links to stories about how the rich view the declining birthrate.

More research is needed in this area, but the statements of some of the most famous rich people are very revealing. The poor are less likely to reproduce due to a lack of money to take care of themselves, even without children. The rich see a high population as an endless flow of customers and cheap labor. The concerns over climate change are also a concern for many people who don't see a planet being left for their children to live in if they did bring them into this world.

## Summary

Because of an interest in preserving the population and/or keeping lots of people here for economic reasons, homosexual, asexual, and transgender people are seen as inherently anti-human because they do not, by nature, create more humans by reproduction. This concern about the birthrate creates a fear in the public that acceptance of LGBTQIA topics to be allowed in society will result in either a decline in population or extinction if people are convinced to become gay or celibate.

This theory is the only secular reasoning I can come up with as to why such a large portion of the population has not accepted those of us with different sexual orientations or gender identities. However, the religious objections are more often in the spotlight and will be the subject of another chapter.
