# How The Chandler Caterpillar Evolved into a Chastity Butterfly

Chastity's Journey into a career in writing began in 2013 when she published a book titled "Confessions of a Confused Virgin". This book project was intended to teach Chastity about the process of self-publishing a book so that she could help her mother, Judena Klebs, publish the books she had written.

However, the people on Facebook enjoyed Chastity's different points of view on dating, marriage, and sex. After that, Chastity started blogging on a WordPress blog about whatever she had on her mind at the time. Eventually, these small posts became content for future books she would publish.

The majority of her writing was a series of conversations she had with a unicorn in a dream. The series remains forever published as "Chandler's Honesty" because Chandler is her legal name even though she is known by her preferred name of Chastity White Rose. Unlike most transgender people, Chastity does not consider Chandler to be a "dead name" but instead a name of historical importance as she evolves from a caterpillar to a butterfly and yet remains the same person.

Chastity is a simple person who prefers playing Tetris or Chess much more than writing. However, she began a project in Pride month of 2025 with a focus on educating the public about the LGBTQIA+ community that is different than the hype you would hear from mainstream media.

Chastity graduated with a Creative Writing Degree in July of 2025 after attending Full Sail University as an online student while working full-time at Walmart in Lee's Summit, Missouri. 

Her best paperback books and ebooks can be purchased from Amazon, Apple Books, Google Play books, and many others. These works cover a range of topics, such as opinions on politics or religion, her Journey as an Asexual Transgender woman (Chandler's Honesty), and even a 100-page book about the board game of Chess (Chastity's Chess Chapters).

But beyond writing books and blog posts, Chastity is offering services to help others write and publish their books, blogs, and websites. Those who have a story to tell but who may not be as technologically inclined may benefit from her experience using Kindle Direct Publishing, Draft2Digital, WordPress, and writing content with Markdown and HTML.

Chastity writes on two main websites that she pays to keep free of ads and distractions.
