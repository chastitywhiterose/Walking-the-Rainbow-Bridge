# Walking the Rainbow Bridge

Creating Conversations for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

Chastity White Rose

# Preface

The year is 2025. Many strange things have happened this year. This year is a time of economic collapse, with rising unemployment rates and a lack of ability to communicate or listen. Many of my people have committed suicide this past year in response to the hatred they have received.

You may wonder what it is I am talking about. I am speaking primarily about the LGBTQIA+ community and the violence and discrimination against them. In many places, it is possible to be killed for not appearing as the gender someone wants you to look or talk like. It is also possible that your family will disown you and kick you out of the house before you have graduated high school because they found out that you are attracted to someone of the same sex rather than the opposite sex.

Transgender and gay people are not the only ones who face additional challenges. Racism also appears to be increasing or, at the very least, becoming more apparent. With the growing number of companies ending their Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion policies, people on Facebook, Reddit, Quora, and LinkedIn are asking questions about what it means.

- Will they be fired because they are black?
- Will they be deported to their country of origin even if they have legally immigrated to the United States?
- Will the marriages of millions of gay, bisexual, or transgender people be no longer considered legal?

And perhaps more importantly, how can anyone afford to live when they are losing their jobs, prices are rising, and they cannot get new jobs because the Artificial Intelligence overlords have decided their resume is not good enough to pass to a real human to read it?

I know these thoughts may seem unrelated, but they have been on my mind lately, based on real conversations I have heard and read, both online and from coworkers at Walmart.

These questions deserve answers, but it will not happen unless we have difficult conversations. Allow me to begin by telling you what I stand for. Look at this picture of the Progress Flag.

![progress-flag_1920x1080.png](https://chastitywhiterose.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/progress-flag_1920x1080.png?w=720)

The [Progress Flag](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2022/06/progress-pride-flag/) is one of the most important symbols to me personally. I consider it the ultimate symbol of Diversity. The different colors and shapes represent different groups of people. One of the key interesting things is that the black and brown stripes represent "people of color", such as those with darker skin colors.

Skin color and/or race does not have much to do with being gay, transgender, or intersex, but what we all have in common is that our differences have been used as an excuse to exclude us from employment, voting, restrooms, marriage, and even life itself when we are murdered or sent to prison for life without having committed a crime.

	"I've paid my dues
	Time after time
	I've done my sentence
	But committed no crime" - Queen

What is the solution to the hatred, misunderstanding, and violence we face? I do not have all the answers, but I want to contribute my part in beginning the conversations to educate each other on our different experiences. We are stronger together because of our Diversity.

What we have in our society is a great divide. We seem to be on two sides of the Grand Canyon. I was thinking to myself that what we need is a bridge. And then it just so happened that I came across an [article](https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/defying-desantis-florida-pride-marchers) where hundreds of people lit up a bridge in rainbow colors using only flashlights.

![rainbow-bridge.](https://chastitywhiterose.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/rainbow-bridge.jpg?w=720)

It was at that moment that I remembered a conversation I had in a dream with Honesty the Unicorn about how a rainbow is created.

---

*H: Like others before you, you will speak and write about the things you have learned. In fact, even now you are typing our conversations on your computer as we speak. You can tell others what you have learned. Though others will probably call you insane or a liar, the evidence speaks for itself.*

*You have the power of perseverance. If you keep on speaking, you will be heard. If you keep on seeking the truth you will find it. For he who keeps asking questions will receive the answers. He who keeps seeking will find them sooner or later, and he who knocks on enough doors will find one answered eventually. You don't know how to give up. You have too much stallion pride for that.*

*C: You're right, Honesty. I don't know how to give up. But where will I go? How do I know where I will be listened to and where I will find the answers?*

*H: Everywhere! Go into all the world. Ask every question, knock on every door, and search everywhere that you have a chance to find the answers. Find those who do not stop you or shame you for singing, dancing, or crying. Do you see that rainbow in the sky, Chastity?*

*C: Yes, how long has that been there?*

*H: Since the moment we first met. In the human world, a rainbow is created when white light is reflected off of water droplets. In Animal Sanctuary, the Light of Truth reflects off the tears of those with a pure heart. By this you shall know that wherever and whenever you see a rainbow, you will know a unicorn is not very far away. For the truth is revealed in tears without a single word said. This is my promise to you, Chastity. You came here because of your tears, and you will return again, as will all those who are honest enough to cry the tears of joy and of pain. For it is as I spoke long ago, blessed are the Pure in Heart, for they shall see God.*

---

I ask my fellow Rainbow people to metaphorically walk the Rainbow Bridge this Pride Month of 2025 as we write, speak, and listen to what our different voices have to say.

As for me, I will remember the Promise of the Rainbow as I was told by [Honesty the Unicorn](https://books2read.com/b/bPwQnz). I won't give up, and neither should you. Please let me know if there's anything I can do to assist you. I am just a poor transgender writer and Chess player, but I offer my skills and knowledge of computer software to anyone who has a story to tell.

# Introduction

This book is a little bit different from all my other books. My chosen profession is Technical Writer. I consider my Chess book, [Chastity's Chess Chapters](https://chastitychesschallenge.com/chastitys-chess-chapters/), to be my best example of Technical Writing because it is an instructional guide full of the tiny nerdy details of playing Chess and how to improve at it. Writing a book like that is easy because there are no negative emotions I have about playing a game.

The topics of LGBTQIA+ rights and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, however, are very emotional. I try to remain purely factual, but at the same time, this is a very difficult topic to write about without crying. Many of my people have been murdered or driven to suicide because of the bullying they experience due to their identity.

What is even worse is that my people are kept in a constant state of poverty because people can be fired from their jobs just for being gay, transgender, or not looking the way they are expected to look. Very few of us are hired for jobs in the first place.

In fact, because of how hard it is for us to obtain employment, many people enter the "Sex Work" industry because it is the only way to survive. This problem creates a never-ending cycle of never being hired because the hiring managers only remember the time they masturbated to you on pornhub and see you as a pure sex object.

Unfortunately, the Rainbow people are kept poor or are forced to hide in the closet who they really are. The one rule that most of us follow is that if you know someone is gay, transgender, etc, never be the one to tell others about them. Each person must come out when they are ready, and it is safe to do so. Being revealed too soon can likely result in them being murdered or losing their jobs, family, and friends at the worst time.

My goal is to help common people understand LGBTQIA+ individuals while also helping our community become better communicators so that we can continue to fight for true Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in all areas of society. I take on this task even though I would much rather be writing a book about how to play a video game instead right now. For many of my people, these are difficult times, and it is a matter of life and death that I write about this rather than my other projects, which are more fun.

This book is therefore considered content writing because rather than being instructions for how to play a game or use specific software, the goal is to help people understand the differences between people so that those who fall outside the majority can be included and treated as equals, especially in the workplace.

# Chapter 1: Building the Bridge

The first step towards acceptance of the LGBTQIA+ community is to build the Rainbow Bridge. There are two main sides to the debate over equal rights for the Rainbow people.

Side A is the people who are themselves lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, or Asexual. We know who we are, and it's easy to forget that others may not have had the same experiences as us. We have many words that we know what they mean, but others outside our community may not. In short, the Rainbow people are basically like computer programmers because 90% of people have no idea what we are talking about. Also, the reason I say we in this paragraph is because I am part of the LGBTQIA+ community. Specifically, I am the T and the A.

Side B are the people who happen to be Cisgender and Heterosexual. The majority of people are this way. They simply accept that if their body is male or female, then that is what they must be. They also only seek to date, marry, or have sex with someone of the opposite sex because they have never felt any attraction to the same sex. Because they have never needed to question the gender roles and stereotypes, they never needed to think about it deeply. Then, when they meet someone from the LGBTQIA+ community, they wonder what is wrong with them.

The ability to understand that other people do not have access to the same information as us is called [Theory of Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind). There is no easy fix for the fact that straight and gay people are not the same. However, it is still pretty easy to realize that a gay man is attracted to men just as a straight woman is. A lesbian (term for a gay woman) is attracted to women the same way a straight man is. At least parallels and comparisons can be made in this case.

Cisgender and Transgender people are also not the same. In fact, they are more different than gay and straight people. It can also be easy to forget that being Transgender has absolutely nothing to do with sexuality at all. It is a state of mind where our brain and/or soul tell us where we fall on the gender spectrum. Because of this, it is more difficult to bridge the gap about this topic. I will, of course, do my best because this is my experience, but I also welcome the input of others who can explain it better than I can.

But if there is any group in the whole LGBTQIA+ acronym that is the most misunderstood, it is the 'I', which stands for Intersex. Intersex people fall outside the male or female **BIOLOGICALLY**. Being Intersex is a fact about your physical body and is not about identity or sexual attraction. The problem is that many people do not know that Intersex people exist. Even one of my best friends told me that everyone is either male or female. But considering things like Klinefelter Syndrome (XXY chromosomes), androgen insensitivity, and those born with both a penis and a vagina, I dare anyone to decide which of the two sexes these people are.

My statement on Intersex identity is that only the person who lives in that body can tell us who they are. For example, I have a dear friend who I admire greatly and who is intersex. She identifies as a woman and aligns with a female gender identity despite having XY chromosomes. In that regard, the same standard of **self-identification** applies to Intersex people just the same as it does to Transgender people. So please, don't tell people who they are because you are not them. That is like telling a child who wants to make music that they must instead become a carpenter and that they are not allowed to play an instrument or sing.

And finally, the Asexual community is perhaps the most controversial within the community because we often fight over two competing definitions of what Asexuality means. This topic will be covered in its entire chapter.

I am qualified to speak from my own experience on Transgender and Asexual identity because it is my own experience. However, just because I am the author does not mean that those of L, G, B, and Q cannot contribute their own experiences. If you would like to join me in future updates to this book with personal stories or allegories that explain your experience, I can include them and give you credit.

Remember, the goal is to build the Rainbow Bridge. I can't do it alone. We are in this together. We can help educate the cisgender, straight people on what our words mean rather than merely calling them homophobic or transphobic and then cutting off communication.

Also, for the record, a phobia is a fear, not hatred. Can you blame the "normal" people if they are a little bit afraid of us? After all, some of us look really strange and use big words that these people have never heard in their lives. Some of them are open to learning and will accept us, but the process of building the bridge begins with us.

# Chapter 2: I Was Born This Way

It is quite common to hear the phrase *"I was born this way"* from gay people. The reason we say this is because being gay is something you are born with and is not a choice, just like your sex or skin color, and as such, it cannot be a sin, nor can it be something used as a reason for discrimination.

Or perhaps it would be accurate to say that we have in our DNA and brain chemistry something that makes us attracted to people of the same sex rather than a different sex. Most of us don't notice this at birth but instead at puberty when people first have the physical capability for sexual activity and most likely are hearing about it in sex education at school.

But some children start noticing people of the same sex at the same time as most people start noticing the opposite sex. It is hard for me to describe, especially since I did not go through this type of experience during puberty. However, I know from the stories of other people that people don't choose who they are attracted to.

Given a choice people would always choose to be heterosexual because that is what society demands of them; heterosexual people have always been able to get married. No one has been murdered or bullied specifically for being straight because the majority are never criticized.

I think that the only reason that gay people are so misunderstood is because we are a minority. The people who make laws about whether gay people are allowed to marry each other or whether they are even allowed to adopt children are decided by straight people who don't know the experience of gay people.

But I completely agree that people are born in a way that wires them to be gay. It also comes as a spectrum. Some people are interested in both men and women simultaneously. In that case, they would be called bisexual. I would even go so far as to say that most people are neither completely gay nor straight but that there are a lot more people who are bisexual or pansexual.

But let me be very clear about something: being gay does not actually mean you are having sex with anyone. In fact, many people are married and have sex with their spouse, who is the opposite sex. Others are celibate because there are people of various religions who believe that same-sex activity is a sin. Therefore, these people attempt to conform to the way their religion and the broader society expect them to be.

But just because a gay man marries a woman and has sex with her doesn't mean he isn't thinking about men while he is doing it. A gay woman can still marry and have sex with a man, but it is questionable whether she is enjoying it.

However, I have personally been studying celibate gay Christians because the idea is fascinating. If someone believes they will go to hell for having gay sex, then they may avoid it their whole life. However, the process is never reversed. No heterosexual person believes that it is a sin for them to have sex. Therefore, they might wait till marriage, but they never avoid it the same way gay people are expected to.


Even when heterosexual people have sex with multiple people who are not their spouses, the Christians don't seem to judge them at all. Somehow, every sexual sin can be forgiven if you are at least doing it with the opposite sex, but if you are doing it with a member of the same sex, then all of a sudden, you are told that you must go to hell because you cannot inherit the kingdom of God (based on 1 Corinthians 6:9 in the Christian Bible).

I am not here to tell you what you should do if you are a gay person. I just wanted to highlight some of the ways that we are not treated the same as straight people. It seems that most of it stems from religious teaching. There are people more qualified to speak from that perspective than I am.

But as soon as society understands that people are not choosing to be gay, then it no longer makes sense to treat them like criminals, especially when they have not done anything about their feelings.

Although being gay is not the same as being transgender, both things are similar in that the person did not wake up and decide to one day turn themselves into the opposite sex. In the case of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, and Asexual, all of them were literally born this way.

That we are born this way is a fact that must be understood; otherwise, none of us would exist. We would choose to feel and be what the majority wants us to be so that they stop persecuting us about it.

I was born this way, but really, I think we are this way before birth. I think we are conceived this way with the code that eventually gets run later in our lives.

# Chapter 3: The LGBTQIA+ Suicide Epidemic

Those of us who are part of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, and Asexual community have a higher rate of depression and suicide than the average person. There are many reasons for this, which I can identify and explain. The following are a few reasons that this is the case.

## 1. We are lonely

The fact that former friends and family turn against us when we come out (or are outed without our consent) results in us being without any support network.

If you have no friends, family, or even a life partner, it can often seem like your existence is meaningless, and no one would notice if you vanished, or perhaps they have even told you to die. Many people who commit suicide feel this way, but at least most have parents, a friend, a spouse, or a therapist they can talk to.

But too often, this is not the case with some of us who receive hate from humans and are even told that God hates us.

## 2. Poverty

Even those of us who are in the closet are often at a disadvantage economically. If you are single due to being a closeted gay person or are asexual or celibate, you often don't have a second income to rely on. If you lose your job, have an injury, or get very sick, you have no one to pick you up. And in many places, even gay couples in a sexual or romantic relationship don't get the same tax breaks or even the ability to have their spouse covered by their insurance.

Society rewards sexual or romantic relationships and puts them on a pedestal. Even friends are "just friends" and are never taken as seriously as a husband or wife. This problem is compounded because Gay couples have to keep their partner a secret and pretend to be regular friends or roommates. It is beyond exhausting to keep secrets just to avoid being a victim of a hate crime or sent to conversion therapy. Relationships are hard enough normally, but when you can't honestly answer the question of whether you are single or in a relationship without lying or people not approving your partner because they were born with the wrong body parts, it gets extra stressful.

## 3. Lack of Healthcare

Healthcare is hard for everyone, but for people who already lack a good job and health insurance, if they have an illness, they have no hope of getting treatment. It is also worth mentioning that for transgender people, the surgeries and or hormones they need to feel comfortable in their own body are either denied by health insurance, or a doctor can refuse to do it for personal or religious reasons. Therefore, many people, including myself, have self-harmed their bodies because they could not get the help they needed from a trained surgeon who can remove their breasts, penis, testicles, or whatever is causing them gender dysphoria.

Also, nobody would seriously have their genitals operated on without a good reason. Although this book is not about my experience specifically, I did have to fight for two years to find someone to remove my testicles. This surgery was needed primarily for reasons of excruciating pain due to testicular torsion, but gender dysphoria also played a large role as well. During that time of intense pain, I used to research suicide methods as well as self-castration methods. It is only because I was finally able to get trained medical help in September of 2020 that I am alive to tell you that I understand why suicide is so common for my people.

## 4. Religious Abuse

The three major monotheistic religions, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, all tend to speak negatively in their holy scriptures and/or the common traditions of the followers of that religion. I cannot speak on most religions, but I can tell you that those who call themselves Christians tend to pick on homosexuality and describe it as an example of a sin that is somehow worse than murder, theft, lying, or adultery. Of course, they deny that they do this.

But the key issue is that in spite of the fact that some people are not even having sex with anyone, they are still constantly preached to and told they have a sinful lifestyle regardless of the fact that they have not acted on their desires. Even so, I would argue that their sexual activity, if any, is between them, their partner, and whichever God they believe in.

But the reason I bring this up is not to bash religion but to explain how a gay or transgender person is often excluded from participating in a religious life. When they are told that they cannot inherit the kingdom of God (see 1 Corinthians 6:9), they can be turned away from finding comfort in religious faith or a relationship with God. Because many people find meaning in their lives through religion, this is one more thing that many LGBT people are not allowed to find comfort and a reason to keep living.

## Resources

When considering the reasons I have mentioned, it is no surprise that LGBTQIA+ people commit suicide at a higher rate because they do not have the same support systems that cisgender heterosexual people do.

In fact, while I was writing this book in June 2025, I received news that the national 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline was ordered to end its "Press 3 option," which matched the caller with someone knowledgeable about LGBTQIA+ issues.

<https://www.thetrevorproject.org/blog/trump-administration-orders-termination-of-national-lgbtq-youth-suicide-lifeline-effective-july-17th/>

When I heard this news, I was quite devastated. I understand that our issues are not the same as other people's general crises that lead them to suicide.

When a person is LGBTQIA+ and calls a suicide hotline, they cannot just talk to some random cisgender straight person who tells them that they probably should stop being gay or transgender, and then all their problems will go away. A lot of people don't trust someone unless they have reason to believe they understand what they are going through. Just like black people probably would not trust white people who have never experienced the targeted hate crimes and discrimination they face. Having special categories for minorities on a suicide hotline is essential for reasons like these.

Not everyone is the same, and if an untrained person says the wrong thing to a suicidal person at their worst moment, that person will most likely die. For this reason, I am obligated to say something about this and try to offer resources that may be helpful to my Rainbow people during difficult times.

The Trevor Project is an organization that helps LGBTQIA+ people in difficult times. I would advise you to look more into it and write the information down so that in the event you are suicidal or put into a situation where you lose your job or home due to discrimination against you for who you are, at least you will have someone to call.

I also included some other hotlines which may be of help. I read their websites, and they care greatly about protecting the privacy of the callers who may be in danger if others find out their personal information.

This year is a very dangerous time. People are trying to kill my Rainbow people, and most of them are driven to suicide by people who beat them down till they have nothing left to live for. I may be only one person, but I have been at the lowest point in life, just as many of you have. Please contact someone for help if you are feeling like ending your life.

# Chapter 4: The Asexual Minority

Much of the LGBTQIA+ community has a reputation for being portrayed as more sexual than straight, cisgender people. I don't believe this reputation is deserved. While we all have similarities in facing discrimination and being different, the letters T, I, and A have absolutely nothing to do with who we have sex with.

Transgender people identify as a different gender role and prefer different pronouns and names than would be typical of our biological sex. We distinguish the inner feeling of gender from the outer appearance of the body. For example, I have never denied being biologically male, but I just don't see myself that way. None of this is a sexual statement.

Intersex people have bodies and chromosomes that sometimes match neither male nor female, according to common definitions. They might be born with more than one set of sex organs, but this does not mean that they use any of them. Some of them do, of course, and that is their business.

Asexual people are represented by the letter A. Asexual people are the least represented of the group because they either lack sexual attraction to anyone or, in some cases, might be sexually or romantically attracted but lack the actual desire to do anything sexual. It is kind of like being full and not wanting to eat food, even if it is food that tastes good.

I can speak on this experience because I am asexual in the sense that I never look at someone and think about having sex with them. Instead, my first thought is asking them if they want to play Chess or read any of the books I wrote. I have never really been attracted in a sexual way to anyone.

There are times when I might be romantically attracted to someone. This attraction means that I might like someone enough to consider whether they would be a life partner like a spouse. However, this remains in the realm of fantasy because it has only happened maybe once or twice after knowing them personally for at least a year. I guess you could say I evaluated them on their personality and couldn't care less whether they were male, female, or intersex. I will never have sex with them anyway, so I don't care if they have seventeen penises and 5 vaginas. I just prefer that they keep their pants on and play Chess with me.

Asexual people are, of course, the minority within the broader LGBTQIA+ community. In fact, some of the LGB people don't really accept Asexual people as being one of them. We are sort of divided between the people whose identity is defined by who they would theoretically have sex with. and the Asexual people who don't have sex with people because the idea doesn't interest them.

It is also worth mentioning that transgender people cannot usually engage in sexuality because they have gender dysphoria and are uncomfortable with the parts they were born with. In some cases, their feelings can change if they have surgeries to change their body into something that they feel ok with.

The main point of this chapter is to explain that, as a whole, you can't assume that someone is having sex with anyone at all, whether they are LGBTQIA+ or even if they are straight. Many people have taken a vow of celibacy for religious or ethical reasons. Even more than that, many of them remain abstinent until marriage and prefer to have sex only with their future spouse. Just remember not to assume the sexual feelings or activity of anyone. You don't know what they are doing, and it isn't really any of your business unless you are their partner or they have shared something with you for some purpose.

For example, I have shared more about myself in this one chapter than most people who have known me my whole life. Most of them know that I can play Tetris or Chess. My co-workers at Walmart know that I am good at stocking Frozen vegetables, and those who read my books know that I am a confused virgin who has still not figured out why people are obsessed with sex. But I share this for educational purposes because I am a writer who likes to educate people on the nuances of different parts of LGBTQIA+ identities so that we can be understood instead of just being a punchline in a movie or TV show while being played by cisgender straight actors who don't even have a clue what we really act like.

# Chapter 5: The Population Conspiracy Theory

While it would be easy to write a chapter for each of the unique problems the LGBTQIA+ community faces every day of their lives, I want to focus instead on where the hatred and discrimination really stem from.

Of course, it would be easy to place the blame on religion and say that it is only because of outdated and mistranslated holy texts. This avoids the issue and pushes it back a step rather than questioning why the religions became anti-gay.

Instead, I propose a new theory that ties the discrimination against Gay, Transgender, and Asexual people.

Did you know that Asexual people are sometimes raped because people want to "correct" them or because they are seen as a challenge to get them to have sex because they are not interested?

Indeed, some people dislike Gay, Transgender, and Asexual people for a common reason. This reason is because these groups are the least likely to reproduce.

- A gay couple of the same sex cannot get anyone pregnant by having sex with the same sex.
- A transgender person, more often than not, takes hormones that diminish their sexual desire and, in many cases, even has surgery to remove their sex organs.
- An asexual person is very unlikely to have sex because it doesn't interest them.

Because these people don't reproduce at the same rate as heterosexuals, some people have an irrational fear that the human race will go extinct because straight sex will stop happening. That plot would make a great science fiction movie that won't happen.

But I have another theory about this that explains why some people have a financial incentive to keep the population as high as they can. Therefore, they see it as their duty to eliminate anyone who is not heterosexual or cisgender.

If you think about it, the very rich, especially business owners, benefit by having a large population.

- More customers means more products sold.
- More competition for the limited available jobs means employers can always find desperate people willing to work for low wages yet feel grateful for having a job.
- More poverty and unhappy people lead to more crime. Then they can be killed or jailed to eliminate the "undesirables".
- More people means there are more people to tax and otherwise exploit for financial gain.

If somebody wanted to keep the population high, they would try to do the following:

- Ban or limit all forms of birth control.
- Eliminate the LGBTQIA+ population and promote heterosexual marriage and sex.
- Ban surgeries that sterilize people.

## Relevant Links about declining birthrates

I have included some links to stories about how the rich view the declining birthrate.

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/07/elon-musk-civilization-will-crumble-if-we-dont-have-more-children.html

https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-pandemic-baby-bust-birth-rate-harmful-civilization-demographics-2021-12

https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/23/health/fertility-rate-cdc-report-trump-pronatalism/index.html

More research is needed in this area, but the statements of some of the most famous rich people are very revealing. The poor are less likely to reproduce due to a lack of money to take care of themselves, even without children. The rich see a high population as an endless flow of customers and cheap labor. The concerns over climate change are also a concern for many people who don't see a planet being left for their children to live in if they did bring them into this world.

## Summary

Because of an interest in preserving the population and/or keeping lots of people here for economic reasons, homosexual, asexual, and transgender people are seen as inherently anti-human because they do not, by nature, create more humans by reproduction. This concern about the birthrate creates a fear in the public that acceptance of LGBTQIA+ topics to be allowed in society will result in either a decline in population or extinction if people are convinced to become gay or celibate.

This theory is the only secular reasoning I can come up with as to why such a large portion of the population has not accepted those of us with different sexual orientations or gender identities. However, the religious objections are more often in the spotlight and will be the subject of another chapter.

# Chapter 6: Can someone be Gay and a Christian?

Many people are told by their Christian friends, family, and church members that being a Christian and being gay are incompatible. This controversy has led many LGBTQIA+ people away from Christianity to seek out other religions or become atheists because they believe they have no choice.

I know this because I was once in a similar situation. Although being an Asexual Transgender person has allowed me to **effortlessly** live a life of celibacy, as many religious people say is the only way for an LGBTQIA+ person to live, it does not allow me to be accepted by most Christians.

And let's be honest about one thing. Most non-LGBT people don't even know the difference between being Transgender and Gay. Who can blame them? After all, we are all suspiciously fabulous.

And although I am Asexual, many people believe it is just my denial of my homosexuality. But I don't deny that I have gay moments 1 percent of the time like that one time I bought a loaf of sourdough bread at the Hy-Vee bakery just because the guy who worked there was cute.

But the main point is I know I will never be accepted by most who call themselves Christians. However, I have come to my understanding with God over time and have learned to conveniently ignore the opinions of people who pretend they know about my "sinful lifestyle" when they don't know anything about me because they haven't spent time with me.

I am not the most qualified to write about all the controversies between an LGBTQIA+ identity and what the Bible or church tradition says. However, I know some authors that have been a great help to me. I want to recommend 3 different books written by 3 different authors.

[Torn: Rescuing the Gospel from the Gays-vs.-Christians Debate](https://geekyjustin.com/books/torn/) by Justin Lee

[God and the Gay Christian: The Biblical Case in Support of Same-Sex Relationships](https://matthewvines.com/book/) by Matthew Vines

All of these books contain historical context and differences in translation between different Bible versions. Justin Lee and Matthew Vines are both gay men who can speak from personal experience in reconciling their Christian beliefs with their gay reality. Kathy Baldock is not LGBT at all, but she started researching this topic because of her experiences with her gay friends.

These books have been helpful to me, but before I found books like this to offer me a new perspective, I had a different way of handling the situation. Instead of seeing my identity as a sin and rebellion against God's design, I think of the example of a butterfly. The following is a post I wrote about it.

## The Meaning of the Butterfly Hairclip

*Chastity stood before the mirror. She was fully ready for work. She had just put her hair in a ponytail using the butterfly hair clip she bought at Walmart, where she worked.*

*She took a good look and realized how much she loved the way she looked. The sight of her always inspired people to ask her whether she was a boy or a girl. The truth that Honesty the Unicorn had given her was that it was complicated.*

*And it is. Chastity did believe that there were two genders, but she knew that she was both of them. Just as the chessboard is half black and half white, so was she more than one thing. Her brother-in-law joked about how she was the best of both worlds. She was both and yet unmistakably felt that a female identity suited her better.*

*After all, Chastity is known as a girl’s name. Of course, it was assumed that if someone vowed celibacy, it had to be a female. So, she knew she was a female Vegan Virgin.*

*But if a man can also take the same vow. He would be Mister Chastity. It was true that Chandler and his experience would always be a part of Chastity.*

*But of course, Chandler had transformed into Chastity just like a caterpillar turns into a butterfly. The symbolism of the transformation of the caterpillar is what her hair clip truly meant.*

*People say that a picture is worth a thousand words. Chastity now knew this to be the truth. She had thousands of words to say. But humans say a lot of things that make no sense. Some say that God does not make mistakes. To those people, Chastity often joked that they would think differently if they ever looked in the mirror.*

*But now, Chastity was standing in front of the mirror. She did not see a mistake at all. She was a hybrid of a man and a woman. Her mother was a writer and poet. Her father was a chess player and kept huge amounts of data on computers about his genealogy.*

*Chastity stored gigabytes of data of a very different type. Chastity stored words and pictures on her computer and cell phone. Sometimes, she even used artificial intelligence to turn her words into songs. She wasn’t a musician like her mother was, but she definitely could sing.*

*Chastity was the hybrid of her parents, but she was more than that. She had both the body and soul of a genderfuck, although she does not fuck anyone of any gender. Because she is Chastity White Rose, the Vegan Virgin, in this, God did not make a mistake.*

*Some said that Chastity was sinning by transitioning to a new name and female identity because God had intended for Chastity to remain a man. But no one would tell a butterfly that it was wrong to transform because that was exactly how God planned it. Who are these humans who claim to know what God had intended for Chastity? She was like a butterfly, and when she wore her hair clip, only those who knew this secret meaning could understand how beautiful it was. Chastity finally had her wings.*

# Chapter 7: The History of Pride Month

Many people know that June is considered Pride month, but there seems to be some misunderstanding of the meaning and the history.

## Stonewall Riots

In the Greenwich Village area of Manhattan, New York, there was a historical event that happened in the year 1969. The Stonewall Inn was a gay bar where gay men and lesbians would hang out. However, at the time, homosexuality was illegal, and so was "cross-dressing". The police frequently raided bars and arrested people for the sale of alcohol and wearing clothing different than what was considered legal for their gender. One time, when the police came to arrest people for these "crimes" on June 28, 1969, there was such a crowd of angry people that they started fighting the police. This conflict continued for about a week. The police won in the end, but by this time, more and more people were tired of being harassed by the police and unjust laws that forced them into hiding.

Each year after this event, a bunch of people marched as a reminder of what happened. This holiday was the start of what would eventually become known as Pride Month. The people were proud to be who they were and were done hiding and pretending to dress and behave the way that the majority of society wanted them to.

When so many people had these events, then people started to see that the LGBTQIA+ people were not just a tiny minority and they could no longer be bullied without them fighting back. At first, June 28 was known as Gay Liberation Day. Over time, the celebration expanded to include the whole month of June.

## The Two Meanings of Pride

Some people take issue with the term "pride" because there is more than one definition for the word.

The first is to generally feel good for being who you are and not be ashamed or trying to change yourself into something you are not. People can be proud of their achievements, and they can be proud of themselves or others.

The second type of pride is where someone thinks they are better or more important than someone because of whatever they have done or for who they are, even if they can't take credit for it. This type of pride is what some refer to as the "deadly sin" of pride.

Strangely, nobody seems to talk about the sin of pride until the subject is LGBTQIA+ pride. It seems that people are oblivious to their pride for the rest of the year. Most people feel pretty good about themselves. However, the only difference now is that gay, transgender, and other people can also feel good about themselves.

## Parallels to Juneteenth

Although not directly related, Juneteenth is celebrated on June 19 of every year. This holiday is similar in that it is a reminder of when slavery for black people ended officially on June 19, 1865. On that day, the Emancipation Proclamation was put into effect, ending the legalized slavery of African Americans.

It is fitting that June contains holidays that are something like "Independence Day" for specific communities that traditionally have not been free in the same way as the rest of the population.

Although I can't speak as much about Juneteenth since I don't know as much about it, and I would prefer to let the black people speak about their own history and pride movement, I would like to remind you once again that the Progress Flag includes black and brown stripes because they are very much part of the progress society has slowly made about accepting different kinds of people.

![progress-flag_1920x1080.png](https://chastitywhiterose.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/progress-flag_1920x1080.png?w=720)

Also, don't forget that Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, and Asexual people of every race, language, and culture exist. Pride month includes everyone, not just the white LGBTQIA+ people.

# Chapter 8: The Alphabet People

I refer to the LGBTQIA+ community as the "Rainbow People". However, that is not what most people know them as. They are most commonly called the "Alphabet People" by those who can't keep up with what seems to be an ever-growing acronym. It started as LGB for a while, and then the T was added to include Transgender people.

While being Transgender is not the same as being Lesbian, Gay, or Bisexual, I believe that it was a very good idea to include it in the acronym because first, someone must figure out what gender they identify as before they can figure out whether they are Straight or Gay.

![chastity_transgender_flag.png](https://chastitywhiterose.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/chastity_transgender_flag.png)

LGBT was just fine because it was four letters, did not take long to type, and fit into a 32-bit integer in a computer file. And then it got ruined when the Q was added. Q is often understood to represent "Queer", which is literally a term for something weird, odd, strange, or unusual. In modern times, it refers to any identity or sexuality that cannot be defined as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, or Transgender but that is still not cisgender and straight.

Others refer to the Q as someone who is "Questioning" and hasn't quite figured out what they are yet. The lack of a common definition is part of what makes the Q confusing in the acronym, but I also understand that the idea was to be vague enough to include people not covered by the LGBT acronym. In this sense, it is much like the plus sign is used in LGBTQIA+. It leaves room for further definitions to be included in the umbrella term of Queer.

I, which stands for Intersex, was added later because it was not for some time that scientists and doctors understood enough biology to know that people are born with mixed chromosomes and genitalia some of the time. Intersex is the only term in the acronym that is specifically about the body of the person being biologically different. Because of this, it can seem like these people should not be included in the acronym. However, I would argue that these people face the same kind of challenges that gay and transgender people face because they face unusual sets of relationship and health problems. Many will also be harassed and questioned by others their whole life, whether they are a man or woman.

The Asexuals were later added with the letter A in the acronym. Because of the conflicting definitions of asexuality, asexual people rarely have an accurate representation. Some of them literally don't have sex with people. Others do have sex but only do it to please their partner or for the social and financial benefits that come with having sex with people.

For more information on asexuality than what I can provide with my experience, I suggest the book "[The Invisible Orientation: An Introduction to Asexuality](https://juliesondradecker.com/?page_id=2162)" by Julie Sondra Decker

I am asexual, but I really feel like most asexual people need to do a better job of educating the public about what they really mean. A little bit less fighting between the sex-positive and sex-negative aces would be great.

By the way, an ace is a short form of asexual. It is also a playing card in a standard 52-card deck.

![ace_of_clubs-1](https://chastitywhiterose.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ace_of_clubs-1.png?w=180) ![ace_of_diamonds.png](https://chastitywhiterose.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ace_of_diamonds.png?w=180) ![ace_of_spades2.png](https://chastitywhiterose.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ace_of_spades2.png?w=180) ![ace_of_hearts.png](https://chastitywhiterose.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ace_of_hearts.png?w=180)

Sorry, I couldn't resist making the playing card comparison.

In any case, you might wonder why the acronym keeps growing and how we can keep up with it. The good news is, you don't have to. Obviously, people will keep coming up with new words and letters to describe themselves. The point of these labels is to help people outside their community understand who they are. Some people make fun of us because we are referred to as something that they can't understand or remember. Others will do their best to understand the meanings of these labels as it applies to the person they love.

Although I have done my best to describe what these terms generally mean when they are used, the best way to really know a person is to talk to that person and ask them questions.

These terms are also not mutually exclusive. Someone being transgender or intersex does not mean that they cannot also be considered straight, gay, or bisexual. However, at this point, the logic breaks down.

Suppose a man named Steve is married to a woman named Alexandra because he was taught that he was supposed to marry someone of the opposite sex. Then he discovers that he is unable to have sex with her because he isn't attracted to her sexually. He loves her personality deeply, but their relationship is never physical.

Instead, he finds that he is sexually attracted to men, but he is committed to his wife, whom he loves and has known for years. However, Alexandra discovers that she would rather be a man and then does a gender transition. Alexandra becomes Alex, cuts their hair short, takes testosterone for a few years, and looks like more of a man than Steve ever did to begin with. Now Steve is attracted to Alex because they look more like a man, but he always loved the person they were inside anyway. They live happily ever after, except for those who criticize them for being in a gay marriage.

But the funny thing is that their marriage wasn't gay at the time but became that way later. I wish Steve and Alex all the happiness in the world, even though I made them up. However, similar stories of real people exist. Sometimes, relationships end because one or both people discover they are not as cisgender or heterosexual as they thought they were when they first met each other. I believe relationships like this probably can only be defined as Queer because no other suitable word for things like this exists.

The point is that the minds and souls of people are quite fluid. People do not always remain the same in the way they feel, and sometimes they find themselves living a life that was not their choice but instead one that they are in because it was **expected** by society.

In this book, I have chosen to stick with the acronym in its current most common form: "LGBTQIA+". I believe that this is sufficient because the plus sign refers to anything else that is not already included by the other letters.

Every day, new terms are made up that I cannot pronounce, nor do I know what they mean. I might be part of the LGBTQIA+ community myself, but I am 38 years old, and I still see things very much the same way I did in the 1990s. I believe in two genders, male and female, but I think there is a ratio between them, and some of us are 50/50, 60/40, or 25/75.

I can't keep up with all the new terminology, so I can understand why people who are not even part of the LGBTQIA+ community would be quite confused and scared by these people who come up with new words and keep extending the acronym. For all we know, by next year, it could be LGBTQIAROTFLMAOSEXYAFBIDGAF.

I love and support you, my fellow Rainbow People, but you gotta do better at not scaring people off with all the new terminology so quickly. People have the right to make words, but they must be clearly defined and gradually introduced to the people in your life.

# Chapter 9: Autism and the Misunderstood Rainbow

No discussion about the Rainbow would be complete without a mention of Autistic people. The Rainbow is a symbol of Autism because it is a spectrum of different colors, just as there are different people with different levels of ability in various skills.

<https://101autism.com/understanding-autism-the-significance-of-colors-and-symbols/>

The jigsaw puzzle piece is also a relevant symbol because of the unique ability of visually autistic thinkers to place pieces of the world together in unusual ways. Some of us are also really good at completing jigsaw puzzles (and playing Tetris, which is the same idea).

But you might wonder what exactly Autism is. I can provide my explanation and point you to some resources. Autism is one of the hardest things to explain. In fact, it may be harder to describe Autism to a neurotypical (non-autistic person) than it is to explain LGBTQIA+ to cisgender straight people.

But because I am even more autistic than I am Transgender, I do believe I can help explain it a bit. Obviously, this is only my experience because each autistic person is different.

It might surprise you that I think in pictures and struggle with words. Words have never come easy to me. I could always talk since I was a small child, but I did not know what the words meant most of the time. I memorized quotes from cartoons and video games and repeated them endlessly.

My strength has always been in math and visual arts. Give me shapes and colors, and I can tell you their number of sides and hexadecimal RGB color codes. Perhaps this is why computer programming languages were always easier than speaking English to humans, although I have obviously improved over the years.

But have you ever tried to explain the difference between a man and a woman to an autistic person? The perception that people with Autism have of the world is very different than it is for most of my readers.

An autistic person is more likely to think in terms of specific examples of something and then generalize over time. A non-autistic is more likely to have a general idea of something abstract enough to apply to specific cases.

For example, when I was a 6-year-old child, I observed that boys were evil because they liked to bully me and physically beat me up at [Lindbergh Elementary School](https://lindbergh.kckschools.org/). I further observed that girls played Tetherball on the playground and that they provided me safety from the boys because girls had cooties and boys were afraid of cooties (though to this day, I never figured out what that means exactly).

My ideas of gender were very different from what other people spoke about it. To me, the role of a boy, girl, man, or woman was about behavior but not about body parts. To put it bluntly, I did not think of people by their penis or vagina because they wore pants. As long as people were wearing clothes, I only had their behavior to judge what kind of person they were.

There is also evidence that people with Autism are more likely to identify as LGBTQIA+ than the general population.

<https://autism.org/lgbtq-and-autism/>

I firmly believe that many other people with Autism are very much like me in that they have to process and figure the world out slowly. It isn't that being autistic makes you gay or transgender, but you may observe that gender is also a spectrum, much like Autism or the Rainbow is.

For example, in the minds of some people, women have long hair, but what about when a woman cuts her hair short? Furthermore, long and short are not absolute but are relative terms.

What about the generality that men are stronger than women? Just because this is true, most of the time, does not mean that there are not women with naturally high testosterone who build muscle faster than other women and even a lot of men. Athletes who exercise get stronger regardless of the silly ideas in our heads over who is supposed to be stronger.

For every rule that can be made to define what a man or a woman is, there is also an exception. Some people like me argue that the rules are flexible because humans made them up and that they can be broken.

But let me finish by telling you a story about the misunderstood Rainbow.

There was a display put up about Autism by two librarians in a library in Sterling, Kansas. The Infinity Rainbow was displayed. Somebody thought it was about an LGBTQIA+ topic and complained. These two librarians were fired and then sued the Sterling Free Public Library.

<https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2023/09/2-librarians-were-fired-after-the-board-mistook-an-autism-symbol-for-a-pride-display-theyre-suing/>

<https://truthout.org/articles/kansas-librarians-sue-after-being-fired-for-displaying-rainbow-autism-symbol/>

I suppose that it can be easy to mistake an Autism rainbow as being a Pride Month symbol, especially since it was displayed in the month of June. However, I would say that people with Autism are included in the spectrum of diversity that must be understood and celebrated for their unique gifts.

No, being autistic doesn't really imply a certain sexual orientation or gender identity. Still, autistic people like me have no filter, and we will say exactly what we think and feel. I believe that the rate of LGBTQIA+ individuals among the autistic community could be the same as the rest of the population, but that WE ARE MORE LIKELY TO ADMIT OUR DIFFERENCE.

If there is anything that Autism is known for, it is our lack of social awareness. Just as the Rainbow was misunderstood at the Sterling Free Public Library, autistic people are also misunderstood because we don't know how to lie and pretend to be something we are not.

I have not even barely scratched the surface of what Autism really means, but I can point you to an expert that you may have heard of. Her name is Temple Grandin. I invite you to read the first chapter of her book *Thinking in Pictures* because she explains it better than I can.

<https://www.grandin.com/inc/visual.thinking.html>

Because I think in pictures much like Temple Grandin does, I do think her books are a good description of my form of Autism.

At the same time, I would also like to say that some people are so gifted with words and communication that they may be autistic but in the "reverse direction" of what is expected. Autism is diagnosed as a social disability, but there remains the possibility that the criteria for diagnosing Autism can also be wrong.

I might have the same type of brain as Temple Grandin, but I think that others might actually be good at talking and understanding humans but be very bad at the visual and spatial talents that I have. I would like to conclude this chapter with my definition of Autism, which I think captures the essence of what I mean.

## Autism Definition

A condition caused by a superpower (talent, skill, ability) that requires so much brain space that there is not much left for other abilities. Autistic individuals can do one or two things very well, but this comes at the cost of other abilities that society thinks are important.

Or said another way, some of the playing cards in our brain deck are missing, but then others were shuffled in from another deck. We have 2 missing queens, 17 extra jacks, and no 5s or 7s.

# Chapter 10: Consistently Pro-Life

In this chapter, I know I am going to lose some readers because if there is anything that is more misunderstood than the religious or political debates over LGBTQIA+ rights and identity, it is the abortion debate.

I know you are not expecting a Transgender person with rainbows all over their social media and book covers to be Pro-Life because the "Pro-Life" movement has traditionally done things that are very "Pro-Death" involving the LGBTQIA+ community.

Most of the Pro-Life organizations and charities are strictly Anti-Gay and Anti-Transgender. Most of these groups are religiously based, and this causes them to only work with people who meet their standards based on their faith. Since many passages in the bible are interpreted to forbid homosexuality and even imply that homosexuals go to hell, the Christians who believe these things seem to prioritize their fight against LGBTQIA+ people even more than they do their fight against abortion.

But let me be very clear here: there is nothing Pro-Life about denying gay people the right to marriage. There is nothing Pro-Life about denying the ability of gay couples to adopt children that straight people did not want or could not afford to take care of, and there is nothing Pro-Life about taking away life-saving hormones and surgeries from Transgender and Intersex people who rely on them for their physical AND mental health.

Nobody has the right to call themselves Pro-Life unless what they are doing actually keeps people alive. You don't get to murder a transgender person on the street and then go to church and talk about being a follower of Jesus. If you do, you are a hypocrite, and even Jesus would tell you so, just as he did the Pharisees and Sadducees.

For me, being **Pro-Life DOES NOT EQUAL BEING ANTI-ABORTION**. Rather, being Anti-Abortion is probably 5 percent of the equation. I follow a consistent life ethic, and this includes Veganism to save the animals and supporting human minorities who face additional challenges because of their race, religion, gender, skin color, disability, or whatever other excuse people use to murder them and take away their jobs, housing, and healthcare.

Therefore, by writing these chapters about the Rainbow people, I am doing my best to be Pro-Life for the LGBTQIA+ community. I hope that even though you may not agree with my opinion that abortion is immoral because it is murder, you can at least see the parallels to the other topics.

There are two important Pro-Life organizations I want to share with you. The first is the Rainbow Pro-Life Alliance. I have been a board member since 2022 and attend the Zoom meetings. What I can tell you based on my experience is that all of these people come from different places and don't share the same opinions on every topic. We do agree that abortion is wrong and that LGBTQIA+ people certainly have a place in the discussion, even though we have been excluded by mainstream Pro-Life organizations and events. After all, most of us are either extremely gay or are straight allies.

<https://www.rainbowprolife.org/>

The second is Vegans for Preborn Rights. Because I am an ethical Vegan who does not eat or wear anything from an animal, I want to be involved with them, too. I don't know them as well, but their website is full of helpful resources explaining the Pro-Life and Vegan connection. Also, they fully support LGBTQIA+ people.

<https://www.vegansforprebornrights.org/>

Oddly enough, the reason I became a Vegan was because I was Pro-Life for humans, and then I just extended it to other species of animals. I have answered many questions about Veganism over the years. I would say I have faced more criticism from co-workers at the jobs I have worked because I am Vegan than I have for being transgender! However, if I had to choose between being called by my correct pronouns and saving the lives of the animals, I would choose the animals every time.

If you want more information on Veganism, I recommend the book "[Why We Should Go Vegan](https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/409738)" by Magnus Vinding. It is available free on Smashwords and is an excellent summary of the reasons it benefits the animals as well as humans if we adopt a vegan diet. I also recommend Magnus Vinding's other books because most of them are about philosophy and ethics. He is an amazing author, and he introduced me to Smashwords even before Draft2Digital purchased it. Draft2Digital is the company I use to publish my e-books to this day.

# Chapter 11: What the Gay Marriage Debate is REALLY about

When I was in my early twenties, I heard the occasional mention of gay marriage. At the time, I did not understand why it was a big deal, nor did I have a clue why gay people wanted so badly to be married. I figured that marriages were doomed from the start and that if gay people wanted to be as miserable as straight people, then let them have same sex marriage!

But that was over 15 years ago, and since then, I have learned so much more in terms of what the debate over marriage equality is about. I can tell you with certainty that it is about money as well as other important rights and privileges that governments only give to married people.

There are more than 1100 benefits that married couples receive that single people don't have access to. The following links cover them in more detail than I could ever explain on my own.

<http://www.whymarriagematters.org/pages/protections-and-responsibilities-of-marriage>

<https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/living-single/201804/unearned-privilege-1000-laws-benefit-only-married-people>

<https://www.getlegal.com/legal-info-center/family-law-divorce/marriage/>

I must admit, I was very surprised to hear that there were so many laws that affect married people and that they pay less taxes than single people. I even remember hearing someone in a podcast mention that he only got married for the tax benefits.

Silly me, I thought that marriage was just a contract of commitment and a ceremony to tell your other friends and family that: "Hey, this person is special to me and I want to spend the rest of my life with them. Anyone who hurts them will get a good old country ass wuppin."

I know that my opinion as a [Confused Virgin](https://chastitywhiterose.com/confused-virgin/) doesn't count for much on the topic of marriage. However, that raises other questions:

- Why are married people respected more than single people
- Why would the government and health insurance companies be so financially invested in making people get married just so that they get financial benefits?
- Why have these same rights and privileges been denied to people of the same sex who basically live like straight married couples do?
- And most importantly, shouldn't marriage be between two people instead of the government and random strangers who get offended about other people's marriages?

It seems there is a lot more to this topic, and my thoughts have evolved a lot over the past 20 years. I naturally support gay marriage because I want my Rainbow people to experience these benefits the same way straight people do.

But at the same time, a part of me says that maybe the idea of *legal* marriage should be abolished entirely. I think that having the entire legal and economic system forcing people to get married for financial reasons or just to give someone health insurance can lead to dishonesty. People may get married to the wrong person and then have a nasty divorce later, all because they got married for tax benefits.

But the law is not the only problem. People also **respect** married people more than single people. If you happen to be a 38-year-old single virgin, people look at you and wonder what the hell is wrong with you that nobody wants to partner with you.

Moreover, it draws suspicion. After a while, people ***who should be minding their own business*** start coming up with their own theories as to why certain people are single and never married.

But I believe in living a life of honesty, and therefore, I am glad that I did not end up in the wrong marriage. If someone gets married to a person of the opposite sex just to gain legal benefits or to avoid judgment by society for being single, then they may face trouble.

- A gay man may be having sex with his wife while he is really thinking about his secret gay partner that he would rather be with, if only it were legal.
- An asexual person may not enjoy sex, but they are afraid to tell their spouse for fear that they will leave them, and they could potentially become homeless without their partner's income and support.
- A transgender person may wish to come out and be their true selves. Still, they know that their spouse would certainly divorce them if they did not approve of their transition, or they just could not take the criticism from society for being married to someone who is so hated by most of the population.

I can tell you, being single gets lonely sometimes, but there are benefits to being single that people who got married at a young age will also never experience. I wish happiness to all the people: gay or straight, single or married.

Everyone must do what is right for them. At no point should the government or anyone else be rewarding or punishing people for who their partner happens to be, or if they cannot find anyone at all who wants to be with them.

# Chapter 12: Why I Don't Use the Women's Restroom

There is a lot I could say about the never-ending bathroom debate, although it will be ignored. The issue would be resolved if unisex restrooms became the norm, as in one person, one toilet, and one sink. This design was how the restrooms were at the Hy-Vee where I used to work. In fact, originally, they had gendered signs. There were 6 restrooms, and 3 were labeled female and 3 were labeled male. Eventually, they got rid of those signed and replaced them all with unisex signs. There was no point in gendering them because only one person went in at a time, and no one's privacy was ever violated.

If businesses took the same method as the Hy-Vee on Rice Road in Lee's Summit did, **there would be no bathroom debate** over whether transgender people should be allowed to use the restroom that matches their sense of gender identity.

This problem is kept alive because **society wants an excuse to be hateful to transgender people**. I am fully aware of this, and I know that my solution will never be implemented on a wide scale. For this reason, I would like to go a step further and explain why I never use a women's restroom.

I don't use the women's restroom because I need to protect myself from the women. The worst men could do to me is rape me or murder me when I use the restroom. However, what a woman can do to me is far worse. If I were ever foolish enough to use a public women's restroom, it would only take one woman in there accusing me of trying to assault her sexually. Of course, it would not be true, but it doesn't have to be. Either way, someone will call the police, I will probably be arrested and sent to a men's prison where I **will be raped or otherwise beaten by violent men much more dangerous than those in a men's public restroom**.

I also would experience no benefit to using the women's restroom. I don't wish to be around women I don't know because I can't trust them not to hurt me. I also don't want to hear whatever conversations they are having. They are probably complaining about men, and they will see me as an enemy and accuse me of being a man. I don't wish to deal with that.

I have used the men's restroom all my life and I have never even once seen the penis of any of the men there. That is because I am not looking for people's genitals! Another thing I like about men is that they go in there, pee, poop, fart, or whatever. No conversations, no doing their makeup, and just getting back to working or shopping.

Although my solution of continuing to use the men's restroom is quite convenient for me, **I completely oppose any law or policy that dictates what restroom people are forced to use**. Such laws are impossible to enforce in any meaningful way. Do police have to stand at the entrance of ALL public restrooms and pull the pants down of anyone who just needs to pee? How does this work with people who have had their genitals removed through surgery? What about women who have short hair and therefore look just like men?

I highly doubt that most people have logically thought about the consequences of trying to legally require people to use the restroom of their "biological sex". It does not take into account intersex people or transgender men who look like someone who belongs in the men's restroom because they have been on testosterone long enough to have a beard and a deep voice.

I am sad that this bathroom controversy exists at all. Still, because it does, I would suggest that both transgender women and transgender men use the men's restroom unless a unisex restroom is available. I have never once been attacked in a men's restroom, but I happen to know a cisgender female former manager at Walmart who was attacked in the women's restroom for the crime of having short hair. Honestly, at this point people are safer in the men's restroom because even though some men in there may be dangerous, they will probably not be able to tell who they can safely rape or who might be strong enough to kick their butt. They will be less likely to take the risk, especially if they are in a room full of people who look like hybrids, just as I am.

But regardless of anything I have said here, do whatever is safer in your specific situation and keep fighting for restroom equality! To police who can use which restroom hurts people who are not transgender because many women look like men if they have short hair, are taller, or are muscular because they work out. If you care about women's safety, you will care about everyone's privacy as they pee or poop. Using the restroom is not optional, and so everyone should be able to do their business free from harassment.

# Chapter 13: My Immigrant Best Friend

The subject of immigration is one that I never researched prior to 2025. All my life, I have personally believed in open borders and that we should not have the concept of countries at all. Of course, I know the legal system doesn't follow my ideals.

However, as someone born in Merriam, Kansas, in the United States of America, I am a citizen by law even though I did nothing to deserve it. Therefore, I have no **moral** right to work or live than someone born in another country who comes here.

But one day, I started a very special friendship with an immigrant at Walmart who came to work there. I started trying to use Google Translate on my phone to translate messages. Most of the time, this wasn't even necessary because she understands more English than I do Spanish.

To protect her privacy, I will refer to her as Fiesta because *fiesta* is the Spanish word for *party*. Working with Fiesta was always a party because when we worked together, we sang and danced. She even knew most of the English songs I know. Although I had only known her for a short time, I can tell you she was one of the best workers I had ever seen. Nobody else besides me at my store ever worked with such a smile on their face.

And then one day she told me that her work visa had expired and she could no longer work at Walmart with me. I was deeply sad about this because I will miss her. I hope that she can become a citizen here or that, at least if she returns to her country that she will be safe.

But based on my reading about this issue, it seems that it is not very easy to become a citizen or even to get a temporary visa status. These rights are limited in number and given only to a small number of people who government officials deem worthy.

But the news in 2025 about immigrants in American politics has often made me question why people would go to such trouble to enter this country. All I can really say is that if someone's country they were born is so bad that they want to come here, then I think they should be allowed to.

But I also think that if immigrants really knew what this country is like, they probably would not want to. They are not treated very kindly by other American citizens. On top of that, many of them may be in great danger in their original country.

Maybe they did not do anything wrong, but their homes were destroyed in a war. Maybe people are trying to kill them because they are gay or transgender. Maybe they no longer follow the major religion in their country and, therefore, are considered a criminal worthy of death. Therefore, because such situations happen, it is not hard to see why someone may go to another country, legally or illegally, when they have to save their lives. I do not judge them because I have no right to. I don't know their situation, and I imagine it must be hard.

Next time you see an immigrant to your country, I would like you to remember this Bible verse. You don't have to be a Christian or Jew to appreciate this, just know that anyone who claims to follow these religions must also consider whether they are following this law of treating the foreigner the same as a native citizen.

>Leviticus 19:33 When a resident foreigner lives with you in your land, you must not oppress him. 34 The resident foreigner who lives with you must be to you as a native citizen among you; so you must love the foreigner as yourself, because you were foreigners in the land of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.

The average American citizen knows nothing about the immigration system in the USA. Even I don't know much, because I have never moved to another country. I guess that most of you probably haven't either. You just judge people and declare them "illegal".

Many other people were also born in the USA. Some of them, I wish I could deport to another country so that they would no longer be here to abuse people they consider less valuable than themselves, based on the chunk of dirt they were born on.

And to my friend Fiesta, I want you to know that you were always the kindest friend to me at Walmart. You did not treat me as less than you because I did not know your language, or because I am transgender. We danced and sang together, and every night was a party just because you were there. I will remember you, no matter what happens. If there is anyone who has a right to work in any country, it is you.

# Chapter 14: The Problem With Nationalism

I understand that Chapter 13 of [Walking the Rainbow Bridge](https://chastitywhiterose.com/walking-the-rainbow-bridge/) has the potential to be greatly misunderstood. It is obvious that I dislike the idea of countries, borders, governments, and citizenship in general.

When I criticize the United States of America, many people will say: ***"If you hate America so much, why don't you move to another country and see how much worse it is!"***

When people say this, what I really hear is: "Yeah, we are not great, but at least we are not as bad as those people over there!"

And yes, I agree. The USA is not as bad as many places in the world. That misses the point entirely. However, I have my specific problems with the USA government. My issue really is with the concepts of countries and states existing.

As should be known by anyone who knows something about American history. The USA, as we know it, started as a bunch of white British settlers who came to this land and started their system. However, there were already native Americans here, and these white settlers from Europe killed and/or moved them continually west until the current day, when only a few descendants remain and some live on small reservations.

As if that was not bad enough, these founders also brought dark skinned enslaved people that they had obtained in Africa. Our history is one of immigrants bringing other immigrants against their will to kill the natives of this land and build an empire that eventually fought to become separate from England.

The Declaration of Independence, written July 4, 1976, specifies in detail the problems the states had under the rule of the King of Britain and why they wanted the states to be an independent nation.

<https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript>

You see, the start of what we know as the United States of America began by criticizing and breaking free from the previous government that the founding fathers had suffered from. The most American thing that can be done is to criticize the government.

Unfortunately, the Native Americans and the enslaved Black people were not so lucky. They did not have the freedom as citizens of this new land. They were enslaved, beaten, whipped, killed, and chased off the land they had been on for generations.

This act of destroying the people of the land and taking over is called colonialism.

<https://www.thoughtco.com/colonialism-definition-and-examples-5112779>

The reason I am not a fan of countries is that they almost always involve colonialism and violence at some point. The European settlers were not born in America, yet they all became citizens. The Native Americans were born here, yet they were not treated as citizens and were forced to give up their land, languages, and way of life.

How then can we say that someone coming from another country to the USA has any more or less right as a citizen to live and work here? Declaring someone like me a citizen because I am born here, and yet not someone who came from somewhere else, makes no sense.

That is why I believe in open borders and equal citizenship for all people regardless of country of origin, race, language, or religion. I am against [nationalism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nationalism). I just don't believe that I am better or worse than anyone because of my birth here.

But perhaps because American history is what I was required to learn, and because the current USA government is taking away the rights of the LGBTQIA+ people right now, I am quite resentful of the powers that be at the moment, as well as the atrocities done to innocent people in the past. It is therefore why all of my books and blog posts have a tone of anarchism and idealism.

I want everyone to get along. I know this will not happen and that wars will continually be fought over land, resources, and religions. I hope that we can bridge the gap between people of different places and cultures in the same way that I want to bridge the gap between people who are straight or gay, cisgender or transgender, and sexual or asexual.

But let me be clear about one thing that must be understood. A state or country is not the same as the people who live there.

- Americans are NOT the American Government.
- Chinese people are NOT the Chinese Communist Party.
- Jews are not the state of Israel.
- Arabs are not a terrorist group.

The people are not the land, government, religion, or anything else. Each geographical location contains many different kinds of people, and they should not be lumped together as if they are all the same.

Just as I don't want the actions of [Rose Montoya](https://nypost.com/2023/06/13/rose-montoya-exposes-breasts-during-white-house-pride-party-after-meeting-biden/) to be associated with me just because she and I are both transgender, I don't want to falsely assume that anyone of a particular identity is evil.

And in the past, I have made that mistake. I have been hurt by many people who call themselves Christians, and therefore, I do have a prejudice that I use to protect myself. The link between the interpretation of specific bible verses has been used to discriminate and commit violence against gay and transgender people.

A prejudice is not the same as hatred or anger. However, when you see a snake, your chances of survival are better if you assume it is venomous and get away from it. Sometimes we have to protect ourselves from those we see as a danger. Having a gut reaction of prejudice is not being hateful, but it is being careful.

What I am saying is that it is important to get to know people rather than letting those prejudices, which protect us in the short term, become something worse that causes us to be the very monsters we assume others to be.

# Chapter 15: Love the Sinner Hate the Sin

So many times in my life, I have heard the phrase "Love the sinner, hate the sin". On the surface, it sounds good because you are saying that you love someone but disagree with what they do, but this calls into question both the intent behind the person speaking it and who they are saying it to.

Interestingly, the only time I can remember hearing "Love the sinner, hate the sin" is when Christians are judging people for being gay or transgender. It doesn't really work very well in this context because the person doesn't know what the "sin" is that they are talking about. Imagine if you said, "Love the black person but hate the sin". This statement implies that you think someone born with black skin has somehow sinned or erred in some way, as if they could have done something different and been born with a different skin color.

I know what you'll say next: "But being gay is a choice!"

First, it isn't a choice in any meaningful sense. Second, if it were a choice, it would actually be a fine choice. Third, you know what *is* a choice? Shutting up when you don't know what you're talking about.

I will use 2 examples to illustrate the point I am making.

## Judging the Gay Person

A person finds out that someone they know is gay. Then they start talking about hating their sin or their sinful lifestyle. But the truth is, a straight person does not know what sin they are speaking about. Are they speaking about the sin of being attracted to the same sex, which is not an action? Are they talking about a specific sexual action the person is doing? Are they in their house watching them as they do this action by themself or with their partner and judging them for doing it wrong? What specifically are they even talking about?

## Judging the Transgender Person

Suppose someone discovers that someone is transgender, or simply assumes it because they don't look like what they think a man or woman should look like. Some thoughts they might have include

- That person is too tall to be a woman! They must really be a man pretending to be a woman! Someone call the police!
- That woman has a deep voice, I bet she is really a man!
- That woman has small boobs, I bet it's a man!
- That woman has facial hair, it's a man! Protect the children!
- That man has boobs; it must have been a woman, but it has a beard. What the hell is it?
- That man sounds like a woman. I bet she tried to act like a man because she was such an ugly woman!

These are just a few examples of the things I have heard or read. Most of the time, these things are said on Facebook or YouTube comments on a news story about someone who was just trying to use the restroom or play a sport.

But what I have noticed is that while gay people are judged for actions (whether real or imaginary), transgender people are judged for how their body looks. Whether they are being judged by how tall or short they are, the sound of their voice, or the size of their breasts (why are people staring at other people's chests so much?), the point of all these sayings is to insult people for how they look. What is the sin they are hating as they claim to love the sinner? Wait, is a woman sinning if she grows facial hair due to Polycystic Ovary Syndrome? What about these thoughts or words about the size of their breasts? Is having a certain size of boobs a sin? What is the correct breast size, and how does someone make their boobs bigger or smaller?

More context is needed even to know what the sin is that they are referring to. Most of the time, this person is very vague on what the sin is. That is because they don't really know any information about the person they are judging. This phrase is used mostly to strangers whom they don't know.

When someone speaks of "sin", the context usually implies that they think the person has made an error or is doing something morally wrong. These two definitions get mixed up. I will call these definitions A and B.

Sin Version A: Making a wrong move, such as moving a chess piece that causes the loss of the game, or forgetting a semicolon in a C program that you are compiling. Or perhaps "missing the mark" when you throw a ball or shoot an arrow at a target.

Sin Version B: Doing something that hurts someone, such as murder, lying, stealing, or committing adultery (having sex with someone other than your spouse).

Sin versions A and B are not the same thing, and they are not compatible. Sin A refers to a mistake made when playing a game or doing some action that has no harmful consequences. Sin B means you did something that hurt a person, either permanently by killing them, or at least temporarily, such as stealing their money that you can theoretically pay back.

Interestingly, when people say "Love the sinner, hate the sin", they are not usually talking about a type B of sin. They don't usually say it about murderers, rapists, thieves, or liars. No, instead they call the police, bring a lawsuit against them, or cut off contact with them. Do they talk about loving these people? No, they are too busy trying to protect themselves from this person who has hurt them or their friends/family.

But more importantly, can you still love someone while you are posting on Facebook about how much you hate someone's sin? It is kind of a hard thing to balance. Love and hate don't usually go in the same sentence. How about just loving the sinner and leaving it at that?

But once again, you are calling someone a sinner, as if somehow they are more in the wrong than you are. It is still hypocritical to speak of your neighbor as someone you love in spite of their being a sinner. When a person says this, they are implying that they are perfect and somehow not being a sinner, and this gives them the right to call someone else a sinner.

> Matthew 7:1 "Do not judge so that you will not be judged. 2 For by the standard you judge you will be judged, and the measure you use will be the measure you receive. 3 Why do you see the speck in your brother's eye, but fail to see the beam of wood in your own? 4 Or how can you say to your brother, 'Let me remove the speck from your eye,' while there is a beam in your own? 5 You hypocrite! First, remove the beam from your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.

It's also worth mentioning that the statement "Love the sinner, hate the sin" only applies in the context of Christianity. Rarely do non-Christians ever use the word "sin". However, the culture, most of which has been raised in one of the denominations of Christianity, understands that you are judging them, even if they are not sure what they are being judged for.

The only advice I can give here is to stop using this phrase unless you are prepared to be very specific in what way you love someone, and also what sin it is that you hate. And **PLEASE CHOOSE A DIFFERENT SIN ONCE IN A WHILE**. The LGBTQIA+ people are tired of being picked on as if we are the only sinners. You would be wise to look at what sins you and many other self-identified "Christians" are doing while distracting themselves with the sins of others, so that they don't have to change their own behavior. Remove all the sin from your own life, then we will talk.

# Chapter 16: Pedophilia is no Joke

An event happened that made me feel suicidal in the winter near Christmas time. A team lead at Walmart decided it would be a good idea to bother me while I was stocking the baking aisle A17. He decided to ask me if I wanted to have children. I told him maybe if I were married and wanted to adopt children. And he said, “No, I mean HAVE children in a way like pedophilia”.

I was upset at the time, but told him I would never hurt a child because I know what it’s like to be molested. He went on, and I went back to stocking and trying to look like I was okay. Inside, I was thinking, “What the hell?!?!?! Why would he even ask me that?”

A few days later, I questioned him on why he asked me that. He said he was joking, but I said it was not something to joke about at work and distract me from my job. He said, “Why does it bother you if it’s not true?”

He apologized, reluctantly, in the presence of the overnight coach who witnessed our short fight.

I was not completely satisfied with this, and he still made plenty of sexual jokes over the next few months. After a while, I really started wondering if he jokes this way with everyone (not good), or if he specifically is targeting me because I am a transgender woman.

At first, I was afraid to report it because I knew the history of LGBTQIA+ people being accused of all being child molesters. It also became more prevalent during this time because of the open political hatred of transgender people during 2024 and 2025. Therefore, I had reason to believe I could be arrested just on the accusation of being a person who was sexually attracted to children, even if I had never done anything to suggest this was true, nor would I have done something sexual to a child even if it were true.

I had a difficult decision to make:

1. Report to ethics and get fired because they will probably think I am a pedophile, and then call the police. I could be written into a sex offender registry, quite possibly be sent to a men’s prison, and be raped by actual violent criminals.

2. Quit my job to avoid seeing this team lead, who apparently thought I was a pedophile and that it was some kind of joke to ask me about it.

3. Commit suicide because I live in a world where other transgender women are murdered every single day by transphobic people who assume they are criminals and deserve it.

4. Stay silent and hope the problem goes away.

I chose option 4 for longer than I should have; however, Pride Month of 2025 broke me emotionally. I started working on my book, Walking the Rainbow Bridge, for my Portfolio 3 project with Full Sail University.

During this time, I did a lot of research and read the worst transphobic content on the internet. I became very depressed as I considered how dangerous the situation was. Finally, I decided to make a report against this team lead to protect other people. No matter what happens to me, I don't want him to talk to someone else this way.

1. It is simply unacceptable to distract someone from the work they are being paid to do with personal matters that should not be discussed in the workplace.
2. Even if someone is a pedophile, this is not the same as a child molester. People don't have to have sex with someone they are attracted to. Therefore, they are not a threat to anyone, especially if all they are doing is stocking shelves at Walmart.
3. Pedophilia is no joke. It is an unfortunate condition to be attracted to children sexually. I feel bad for these people because they were also born with a brain that does not operate in a way society understands, and they face much persecution. This topic is nothing to joke about; no matter who you are or what your position is, it is not funny.

Also, to make matters clear, a Pedophile is someone who is sexually attracted to children. A child molester is someone who actually tries to have sex with children. A person can be a pedophile but never have sex with children. A person can molest a child even if they are not a pedophile. These two things are only loosely related.

I am tired of being treated as if I were some kind of danger to children. I was quite offended and depressed at the thought that this team lead thought that I wanted to have sex with children. Even now, I worry about what led him to think this about me. Is it because I am transgender, or is he trying to tell me something about himself? Either way, this has no place at Walmart or anywhere, for that matter, except perhaps a therapist's office.

The only reason I wrote this is so that people are aware of the reality that the innocent rainbow people are often accused of unspeakable crimes against children. But that's not even the worst part. Those who are raping children are not the ones being called pedophiles. Most children are raped by their own fathers or a catholic priest. An overnight stocker at your local Walmart is not someone you should be afraid of. But that one team lead who thinks Pedophilia is some kind of joke, I still worry about him whenever I have to work overnight at Walmart.

The conversation on the topic of Pedophilia should be had only outside of the workplace, but I do believe it is worth discussing. There are two main types of pedophiles.

1. The people sexually attracted to children who will try to rape them if they have the chance.
2. The people sexually attracted to children who, despite being sexually attracted to them, know that children cannot consent to sexual behavior of any kind. They know it is wrong to hurt children and would never do anything.

However, society in general does not know the difference between these two types. More importantly, those who are born with the unfortunate condition of being attracted to children don't really have a way to seek help. If they talk to a therapist about it, that therapist will probably be required to report it to others, and therefore, the person ends up on a sex offender registry, despite not committing any crime or even intending to.

Therefore, the sad truth is that it seems the only option for a pedophile is to commit to a life of celibacy and keep their attraction a secret. Perhaps this is why the profession of being a catholic priest seems so attractive to people with this condition.

But I also can't help but wonder why people have repeatedly accused me of being a pedophile. My only guess is that they take my lack of sexual interest and lack of any activity as a sign that I am the same as those priests who claim to be celibate but are raping children.

The difference is that I am a celibate person, not because the catholic church mandates it, but because it is the right thing to do. Unlike most Christians who view homosexuality as a sin, I apply the same standards to all sexual activity, no matter whether it is heterosexual, homosexual, adult, or child.

I would prefer a world where biological sex and genitals didn't even exist. Then no more children would be hurt. I say this as a child who was raped at the age of two years old.

No, I am not a pedophile, and no, I do not in any way condone sexual relations with children. However, if being paranoid and protecting your kids from anyone who you think is a threat keeps them safe, then I suggest you do so.

I have intentionally held back writing this chapter for months, even though it was on my mind constantly. However, just a few days ago, on September 10th, 2025, Charlie Kirk was shot in the neck and died very quickly. I just wanted to make sure that before someone shoots me in the neck that I have written what I need to say. Every death is a reminder of how short and unpredictable life is. Don't wait until it is too late to write the book you have been planning, spend time with your loved ones, and live authentically for what you believe in, even though doing so is probably why someone will shoot you for it.

# Chaper 17: Blessed are the Peacemakers

Right now in September 2025, the world has gone mad on social media with everyone having an opinion on the murder of Charlie Kirk. I have no such opinion about him but I think it is a fine time to remind you why I have been committed to non-violence for many years. Therefore, my only statement that I will ever make is that it doesn't matter who Charlie was or whether you like the things he said, the fact is, nobody should be shot just for what they are speaking.

I didn't know Charlie and I didn't know who he was prior to his being shot on September 10, 2025. However, I thought it was quite strange that this one act of murder got so much media attention, even though people are getting shot, bombed, stabbed, or starved to death, including many of those who are innocent and have done nothing wrong.

Although I didn't know Charlie Kirk personally, I think he had the right idea because he did not commit violence against people but instead he had debates with them and talked about disagreements rather than resorting to violence. He talked to people and he said some things that people disagreed with sometimes. After the news broke that he was shot, many people on Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok were celebrating that he was shot and said he deserved it.

The real tragedy is not the death of Charlie Kirk but instead the death of freedom of speech. If you kill someone just because you don't like what they said, then the same reasoning could be used to kill you when someone doesn't like what you said.

Moreover, I think violence is for the weak. I think it takes a stronger person to have difficult conversations about areas of disagreement and try to resolve them through peaceful means. I personally think that guns, bombs, and all manner of military equipment should be destroyed because nobody should be killing anyone.

Let me be clear, I understand that others are violent and that they do not follow my philosophy of radical pacifism and peaceful protest. I also don't think someone can reach this stage without an evolution in ethics and a strong moral framework based on a solid philosophy or religion.

To be a peacemaker is to take the hard route, instead of the easy path of violence. Living peacefully and resolving conflict takes time, conversations, studying history, reading books, and considering each new issue as they arise.

Charlie was not perfect. He was just as flawed as any human is, but he did identify as a Christian and I think he would have understood that violence is not good. Those who call themselves Christians would do well to remember what Jesus said about the importance of being peaceful and non-violent.

*Matthew 5:9 Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called the children of God.*

*Matthew 26:47 While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived. With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and elders of the people. 48 (Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, “The one I kiss is the man. Arrest him!”) 49 Immediately he went up to Jesus and said, “Greetings, Rabbi,” and kissed him. 50 Jesus said to him, “Friend, do what you are here to do.” Then they came and took hold of Jesus and arrested him. 51 But one of those with Jesus grabbed his sword, drew it out, and struck the high priest’s slave, cutting off his ear. 52 Then Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back in its place! For all who take hold of the sword will die by the sword. 53 Or do you think that I cannot call on my Father and that he would send me more than 12 legions of angels right now? 54 How then would the scriptures that say it must happen this way be fulfilled?” 55 At that moment Jesus said to the crowd, “Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me like you would an outlaw? Day after day I sat teaching in the temple courts, yet you did not arrest me. 56 But this has happened so that the scriptures of the prophets would be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples left him and fled.*

# Chapter Z: The Call to Action

This book will forever be a work in progress. I plan to add chapters occasionally over time as new topics are suggested and as I learn more about those I have already mentioned. I have invested a lot of time and money in books to read and/or listen to so that I can be more accurate in my future chapters or corrections to existing chapters.

No book is ever complete because there is no end to what can be learned about a topic. Future editions are always needed, even for Chess books! But LGBTQIA+ rights are very much under attack in many places in the United States of America at this time. Therefore, I have decided to go ahead and publish this book in its current form because if something happens to me, there is no one else who has the ability to keep my work going.

Therefore, I have a request of my Rainbow people: if the chapters of *Walking the Rainbow Bridge* have helped you in any way, please share them anywhere you wish. I publish new chapters on both of the following sites to make sure they are not lost in the event of my death.

<https://chastitywhiterose.com/walking-the-rainbow-bridge/>

<https://chastitywhiterose.github.io/Walking-the-Rainbow-Bridge/>

Also, anyone is free to ask me questions or contribute a topic that they would like included in this book. I want this to be a community effort rather than just me writing about my own experiences. Different people have different stories and opinions to offer. My experiences are not the same as everyone else's.

I also don't like that all people of a minority are lumped together as if we are all the same. Each letter of the LGBTQIA+ acronym is only a label that applies to millions of people within that category.

Therefore, I look forward to hearing from my Rainbow people and their allies about how we can build the Rainbow Bridge together and be fabulous!

If you are new to my work, I recommend reading the series: Chander's Honesty.

It establishes the history I have gone through in almost my entire life as I talk to a unicorn named Honesty. It began when I was 31 years old and was honest with myself about everything. That was also the year I came out as Transgender.
